Mayorkas has made cybersecurity a top priority for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in alignment with the Biden-Harris Administration’s priorities. On September 27-28, 2023, DHS hosted the first Western Hemisphere Cyber Conference, which convened foreign government cyber leaders to discuss cybersecurity challenges and identify areas of collaboration.The DHS workforce is comprised of extraordinary public servants who safeguard this nation around the clock – responding to cyberattacks; protecting and saving lives on land, at sea, and in the air; securing our nation’s borders and critical infrastructure; deploying across the country to help Americans recover from disasters; and so much more. Any lapse in federal funding would disrupt this vital work, leaving Americans less safe as a result.
